## Project Overview

This project explores customer segmentation using machine learning techniques. Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics such as demographics, purchasing behavior, and preferences. By understanding the distinct segments within a customer base, businesses can tailor marketing strategies, product offerings, and customer service to better meet the needs of each segment.

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to analyze a dataset containing customer information and identify meaningful segments within the customer base. By clustering customers into distinct groups, we aim to gain insights into their behavior, preferences, and characteristics. This information can be used to personalize marketing campaigns, improve customer targeting, and enhance overall business performance.

## Objective

- Explore and preprocess the dataset to prepare it for clustering analysis.
- Apply machine learning techniques, such as KMeans clustering, to segment customers based on relevant features.
- Evaluate and interpret the clustering results to identify meaningful customer segments.
- Generate insights and recommendations for business decision-making based on the identified segments.

## Libraries Used

The following Python libraries are used in this project:

- numpy 
- pandas 
- matplotlib
- seaborn 
- sklearn
